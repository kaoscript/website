# Coverage

kaoscript provides code coverage via the [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) instrumentation: [@kaoscript/coverage-istanbul](https://github.com/kaoscript/coverage-istanbul).

You can look at `istanbul.json` in the project [@zokugun/lang](https://github.com/ZokugunKS/lang) to discover an easy integration between mocha, Istanbul and kaoscript.
It generates a report on the command line and as html pages (with minimap of warnings and errors).
