# Getting Started

## NodeJS

kaoscript requires at least [NodeJS] v4.5.

I recommend the use of [nvm] to manage and install [NodeJS].

## Install

With [NodeJS] previously installed:

```bash
npm install -g kaoscript
```

## Hello World

```kaoscript
#![bin]

extern console

console.log('Hello World!')
```

Copy the previous code to a file named `hello.ks`.

Execute the code with the command `kaoscript hello.ks`.
