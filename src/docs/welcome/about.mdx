# About kaoscript

## What's kaoscript?

kaoscript is programming language combining features from ES7, CoffeeScript, TypeScript, Rust, Swift, C# and more.

Currently, kaoscript is transpiled to JavaScript.

## Why?

This project came to life due to an issue of JavaScript:

- It's **not recommended to extends natives classes** to avoid any conflict with a JavaScript engine or a dependency.

But, because of that issue, your code consistency is broken!

For example, to call the array's functions `map` and `clone`, it is written differently:
- `array.map(...)`
- `_.clone(array)`

So how kaoscript fixes that issue?

kaoscript compiles `array.clone()` to `_.clone(array)` so you can keep your code consistency.

But, now, it became much more than that :wink:

## Features

> :construction: This project is still in an **experimental state** due to **major missing features** like trait, mixin and operator overloading.

- **easy syntax**: close to ES6 and Swift
- **fully OOP**: extendable native classes but fully compatible with the node.js
- **partial/impl paradigm**
- **async/await**: don't need ES7
- **check variables existences**
- **automatically declare variable**: `i = 0` => `let i = 0`
- **array range**
- **for/to, for/til, for/in, for/of, for/range, until**: no more `for(;;)`
- **comprehensions**
- **typed or not** `let i = 0` or `let i: Number = 0`
- **automatic typing**: on assignement with operator `:=`
- **type alias**: `type float = Number`
- **generics**
- **chained operations**: `1 < x < 10`
- **enum**
- **namespace**
- **import/export**: `import` is the equivalent of node.js `require`
- **require**: declare requirements (only for a module)
- **extern/declare**: explicit global scope
- **typed import**: import non-kaoscript objects and indicate their types
- **function overloading**
- **advanced parameters**
- **error handling**: by default, it's Ã  la Java but it's configurable
- **attributes**
- **conditional compilation**
- **macro**

## Roadmap

### v1

- Implements all [*accepted* features](https://github.com/orgs/kaoscript/projects/1)

### v2

- Transpile to another language (Go, Python or Haxe)
