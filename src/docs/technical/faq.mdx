# FAQ

## Why `new` keyword?

Simple, I have found any better syntax

### meaning

The `new` keyword only means the creation of a container type (class, struct or tuple) and doesn't have anything to do with memory management.

### explored alternatives

### rust style

```kaoscript
var shape = Shape { 'Red' }
```

#### advantages

- upfront with class (`Shape`)
- upfront with container type (`{}` <=> `object`)

#### disadvantages

- won't work for tuple (`Pair [0, 1]`)
- aweful with generics (turbofish `Shape::<Rectangle> { 'Red' }`)

### cast style

```kaoscript
var shape = { 'Red' }:Shape
```

#### advantages

- upfront with container type (`{}` <=> `object`)
- works with generics (`{ 'Red' }:Shape<Rectangle>`)
- works with tuple (`[0, 1]:Pair`)

#### disadvantages

- delayed type, ok for small object, bad for long instantiating
- deferred parsing for non keyed object or keyed array

### new style

```kaoscript
var shape = new Shape('Red')
```

#### advantages

- upfront with class (`Shape`)
- works with generics (`new Shape<Rectangle>('Red')`)
- works with tuple (`new Pair(0, 1)`)
- paired with `drop` keyword

#### disadvantages

- hidden container type
