# Cache

Since kaoscript compilation is on the heavy side, its compiler use cache files to avoid to have to recompile every files when it doesn't need to.

|   type   | extension | description                                                | example                 |
|:--------:|:---------:| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
|  binary  |  `.ksb`   | this is the compiled code for a targeted engine            | `.index.ks.v8-v6.6.ksb` |
|  hashes  |  `.ksh`   | includes all the used files with their hashes              | `.index.ks.ksh`         |
| metadata |  `.ksm`   | include the metadata use when importing the current module | `.index.ks.ksm`         |

You can use the command `kaoscript clean` to clean all those caches files.
