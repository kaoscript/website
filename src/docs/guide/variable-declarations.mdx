# Variable Declarations

## const

```kaoscript
const name = 'John'
```

`const` declares the variable `name` as **immutable reference**. But the referenced value can be modified.

```kaoscript
const names = ['John']

names.push('Jane')
// names: ['John', 'Jane']

// but
names = ['John']
// will through an error
```

If not type is provided, `const` will deduce the variable's type based on its value.

```kaoscript
const name = 'John'
// type: String

const names: Array = []
// type: Array
```

The type of a variable declared with `const` can't be changed.

## let

```kaoscript
let name = 'John'
```

`let` declares the variable `name` and it's rebindable.

```kaoscript
let name = 'John'

name = 42
// no error
```

If a type is provided at the declaration of a variable, its type can't be changed.

```kaoscript
let name: String = 'John'

name = 42
// throws an error
```

But if no type is provided, it will automatically deduce its type based on the current value.

```kaoscript
let name = 'John'
// type: String

name = 42
// type: Number

func foobar() {
	return 'hello'
}

name = foobar()
// no type
```

`let` can also make the deduced type immutable.

```kaoscript
let name := 'John'
// type: String

name = 42
// throws an error
```
