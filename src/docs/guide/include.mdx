# File Inclusion

## include

`include` copies the code from the given file into the current code.

### examples

```kaoscript
include '@kaoscript/util'
```

### file resolution

To avoid any possible dependency injection due to automatic file resolution, the following features are enabled:
- **mandatory file extensions**: to resolve relative or absolute paths, the file extension must be provided (`include './type.ks'`)
- **no directory discovery**: the directory index must also be provided (`include './utils/index.ks'`)

### `npm:` scheme

Including npm modules is done by using the `npm:` scheme (`import 'npm:@kaoscript/ast'`)

### export

When including a file from a module, the `export` statements aren't included.

### syntax

```syntax
include (
	{
		("*file-name*")+
	}
	|
	"*file-name*"
)
```

## include again

By default, if the same file is included a second times, nothing will append.

`include again` is to be used to include a file several times.

### syntax

```syntax
include again "*file-name*"
```
