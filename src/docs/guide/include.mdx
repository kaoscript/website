# File Inclusion

## include

`include` copies the code from the given file into the current code.

### syntax

```syntax
include "*file-name*"
```

### examples

```kaoscript
include '@kaoscript/util'
```

## include again

By default, if the same file is included a second times, nothing will append.

`include again` is to be used to include a file several times.

### syntax

```syntax
include again "*file-name*"
```
