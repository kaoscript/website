# Comments

Comments in kaoscript are very similar to comments in C.

## single-line

A single-line comment begins with `//`. Everything between `//` and the end of line is ignored.

```kaoscript
// a single line comment
```

## multiline

A multiline comment begins with `/*` and ends with `*/`.

```kaoscript
/*
	a multiline comment

	TODO: test
*/
```

Multiline comments in kaoscript can be nested inside other multiline comments.
It enable you to comment out large blocks of code, even if it contains multiline comments.

```kaoscript
/*
	a multiline comment

	/* can be nested */

	a multiline comment
*/
```
