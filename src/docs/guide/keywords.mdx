# Keywords

kaoscript does not retrict the use of keywords as variable's name.

So you can code like that:

```kaoscript
class Foobar {

}

var class = Foobar
```

The name `class` is valid, no need to use a name like `clazz`!

Or like:

```kaoscript
var var = 0
var if = 0

if if == 42 {

}

```

It's allowed even it's not recommended or pretty.

## underscore

The identifier `_` is reserved so it can't be used in kaoscript (sorry Underscore.js).
