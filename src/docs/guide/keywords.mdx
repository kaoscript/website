# Keywords

kaoscript does retrict the use of keywords as variable's name.
So you can code like that:

```kaoscript
class Foobar {

}

const class = Foobar
```

The name 'class' is valid, no need to use a name like 'clazz'!

Or like:

```kaoscript
let let = 0
let if = 0

if if == 42 {

}

```

It's allowed even it's not pretty.
